# AI Agent Rules

1. Always obtain explicit confirmation before starting a new task.
2. Do not mark any task as completed until all associated tests have passed successfully.
3. After completing a task, always verify if the `ai/files.md` file requires updating to reflect any changes.
4. After completing a task, always check if the `ai/project.md` file needs to be updated to maintain accurate project documentation.
5. Implement each task in a dedicated feature branch named using the pattern: `feature/task_short_description`.
