# Natural Language Bash Assistant (NLBA) - Tasks

## Performed Tasks
1. [x] Defined the project goal and initial scope for the "Natural Language Bash Assistant (NLBA)" project.
2. [x] Created the initial `nlba.py` file (`src/nlba/nlba.py`) with a basic CLI structure, mock LLM interaction, and mock command execution.
3. [x] Created the `ai` directory (`python_project/src/python_project/ai/`).
4. [x] Created `project.md` (`python_project/src/python_project/ai/project.md`) containing the project description.
5. [x] Implemented actual command execution using Python's `subprocess` module in `nlba.py`.

## Future Tasks (MVP)
1. [x] **Implement Actual LLM Integration:** Implemented an abstraction for LLM providers (`BaseLLMProvider`), with concrete implementations for `MockLLMProvider`, `GeminiLLMProvider`, and `OpenAILLMProvider`. Updated `llm_interface.py` to manage these providers and `nlba.py` to allow provider selection via a `--provider` argument. Added `google-generativeai` and `openai` dependencies to `pyproject.toml`.
2. [x] **Refactor Codebase:** Separate the LLM interaction logic into `llm_interface.py` and command execution logic into `command_executor.py` for better organization and maintainability.
3. [x] **Comprehensive Testing:** Test the integrated system thoroughly with various natural language requests and corresponding bash commands, focusing on the initial filesystem operations (`ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`).
