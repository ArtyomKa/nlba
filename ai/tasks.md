# Natural Language Bash Assistant (NLBA) - Tasks

## Performed Tasks
1. [x] Defined the project goal and initial scope for the "Natural Language Bash Assistant (NLBA)" project.
2. [x] Created the initial `nlba.py` file (`src/nlba/nlba.py`) with a basic CLI structure, mock LLM interaction, and mock command execution.
3. [x] Created the `ai` directory (`python_project/src/python_project/ai/`).
4. [x] Created `project.md` (`python_project/src/python_project/ai/project.md`) containing the project description.
5. [x] Implemented actual command execution using Python's `subprocess` module in `nlba.py`.

## Future Tasks (MVP)
1. [ ] **Implement Actual LLM Integration:** Replace the mock logic in `LLMInterface.generate_bash_command` (within `nlba.py` or a new `llm_interface.py`) with calls to a real LLM API (e.g., Google Gemini API, OpenAI API). This includes installing necessary SDKs, setting up API keys, and crafting effective prompts.
2. [x] **Refactor Codebase:** Separate the LLM interaction logic into `llm_interface.py` and command execution logic into `command_executor.py` for better organization and maintainability.
3. [ ] **Comprehensive Testing:** Test the integrated system thoroughly with various natural language requests and corresponding bash commands, focusing on the initial filesystem operations (`ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`).
